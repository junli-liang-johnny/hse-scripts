It essentially measures the burden on the working population to support the non-working age groups ( can be calculated by adding people aged 0-15 to those aged 65+ and dividing the whole lot by people aged 16-64 years)            NaN  Include in Delphi                                             NaN                                    NaN  https://data.cso.ie/table/PEC22                      NaN                        NaN         NaN              NaN          NaN    NaN  DEMOGRAPHICS               NaN                     NaN               NaN                      NaN        NaN                                                                                                                                        CSO - Population and Labour Force Projections                             NaN                                 NaN\n",
